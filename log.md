# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 9, 2019 (Example 1)

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Environment set up and installed all necessary npm packages and started with creating 2 Models on server side 
which is Article.js, User.js in models and its schema on mongodb


**Thoughts:** I kind of followed the article https://codeburst.io/build-simple-medium-com-on-node-js-and-react-js-a278c5192f47 
 and created the models. Yet to start on Controller/Routes. I kind of understood how the models and its methods will be created. 
 Need to focus on mongoose and mongodb once the app is done. Now I m really focusing on getting to know node apis and react/redux
 
 Happy Coding !
